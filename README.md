# Technical test from jolimoi
The only purpose of this repository is to answer the technical test given by Joilimoi during their recruitment process.

## Intructions 
You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/Jolimoi/data-analyst-interview)

## Set up 
You will find in this repo jupyter notebook, installation tuto [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#new-to-python-and-jupyter)  

You will also need additional packages to run the entire script. I recommend using pip :
```
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```
I also use sqlite3, os and datetime modules but those are already available if your python is up to date.

For the last part of this work, you will need at least python 3.5 because of the utilisation of kmodes modules
```
pip install kmodes
```

## Some recomandation
I highly recommend that you start your reading with the [report](https://github.com/Martin-Labenne/Jolimoi_Technical_Interview/blob/master/notebook/Report.ipynb) if you want to get an overview.
